- **b.**
  The recurrence for work and span are the same. The work and span big solutions are also the same. W(n) = W(n-1) + 1 and Big Oh is O(n). S(n) = S(n-1) + 1 and Big Oh is O(n).

- **d.**
W(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(logn)

- **f.**
W(n) = 2W(n/2)+1 and Big Oh is O(n).
S(n) = S(n/2) + 1 and Big Oh is O(logn).
